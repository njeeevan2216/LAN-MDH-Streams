# LAN MDH Streams

This was created as a fun project to stream music in our hotel LAN environment.
Thanks to [@romulan-overlord](https://github.com/romulan-overlord) for giving the idea to use socketio for Live broadcasting the loop over the network

Note: The live Broadcast broadcasts only the timestamps of the audio, which the client follows
